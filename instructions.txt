Object of the Game:
-------------------
To outsmart your opponent with a clever code or great guesswork.
As the Codemaker: the system sets a mystery code such that it will keep the opponent guessing for as long as possible.
As the Decoder: you must break the secret code in the fewest number of guesses.


Rules:
------
1)The sequence can contain pegs of colours: red, yellow, green, blue,pink,violet,orange.
2)A colour can be used any number of times in the sequence.
3)All four pegs have to be given with the first letter of the colour and the required position.
  For example, if you want to enter red colour at position 1, the input format has to be 'R1' or 'r1'.
4)Each guess must consist of 4 peg colours and the corresponding positions with no blanks and empty spaces.
5)After each guess,the player has an option to submit or change the sequence by entering 'S' or'C'.
6)The player has 8 guesses to find the secret sequence.



Scoring:
--------
For each of the pegs in your guess that is the correct color and in the correct position, the computer will generate one red peg. If you score 
4 red pegs on a guess, you have guessed the secret sequence.
For each of the pegs in your guess that is a correct color in an incorrect position, the computer generate a white peg. Together, there will 
be no more than four red and white pegs for each move.
If none of the pegs in your guess is of a correct color, you will see no pegs.
